/**
 * This class extends {@link BufferedTokenStream} with functionality to filter
 * token streams to tokens on a particular channel (tokens where
 * {@link Token#getChannel} returns a particular value).
 *
 * <p>
 * This token stream provides access to all tokens by index or when calling
 * methods like {@link #getText}. The channel filtering is only used for code
 * accessing tokens via the lookahead methods {@link #LA}, {@link #LT}, and
 * {@link #LB}.</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * By default, tokens are placed on the default channel
 * ({@link Token#DEFAULT_CHANNEL}), but may be reassigned by using the
 * {@code ->channel(HIDDEN)} lexer command, or by using an embedded action to
 * call {@link Lexer#setChannel}.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note: lexer rules which use the {@code ->skip} lexer command or call
 * {@link Lexer#skip} do not produce tokens at all, so input text matched by
 * such a rule will not be available as part of the token stream, regardless of
 * channel.</p>
