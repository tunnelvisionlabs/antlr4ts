/**
 * The interface for defining strategies to deal with syntax errors encountered
 * during a parse by ANTLR-generated parsers. We distinguish between three
 * different kinds of errors:
 *
 * <ul>
 * <li>The parser could not figure out which path to take in the ATN (none of
 * the available alternatives could possibly match)</li>
 * <li>The current input does not match what we were looking for</li>
 * <li>A predicate evaluated to false</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * Implementations of this interface report syntax errors by calling
 * {@link Parser#notifyErrorListeners}.
 *
 * <p>TODO: what to do about lexers</p>
